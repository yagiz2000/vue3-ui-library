# vue3-ui-library
Vue-3 ui library as a plugin

# Aim
This package aims to represent my learning journey of how to build component library. In the following phases I will implement oruga ui, 
which is very powerfull and customazible library independent of any mainstream css frameworks. Also i want to implement storybook to test my components.
Finally i want to add a beautiful documentation by using vuepress. 

# Usage
1. npm i @yagizcer/test-lib-vue-3
2. Inside your src/main.js import plugin from '@yagizcer/test-lib-vue-3'
3. and edit createApp line as a createApp(App).use(plugin).mount('#app')
4. Now you can use components in .vue files by writing tags like <YButton />
